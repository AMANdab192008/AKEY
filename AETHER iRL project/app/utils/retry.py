"""
RETRY UTILITY
=============

Calls a function and, if it raises, retries a few times with exponential backoff.
Used for Groq and Tavily API calls so temporary rate limits or network blips
don't immediately fail the request.

Example:
    response = with_retry(lambda: groq_client.chat(...), max_retries=3, initial_delay=1.0)
